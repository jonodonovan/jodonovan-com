It didn’t matter what crazy idea for an event or meeting I asked him for he made it happen. Later, I was fortunate enough to have Jon join the marketing department where we worked side by side. He is an asset from web site development to social media. Oh, he also has a great sense of humor. In the 5 years I worked with Jon he made me laugh during the days when we needed it most.
